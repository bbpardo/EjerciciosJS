/**
 * JavaScript can work with many types of data.
 * Primitives are the simplest types of data who JavaScript can handle.
 * Most common primitives are:
 * - numbers, like 1 or 1.5
 * - strings like "Hello world"
 * - boolean can be true or false
 * - undefined is the kind of data when no data are provided.
 * - null is the kind of data for avoiding providing data. 
 * 
 * Exercice:
 * Declare five variables and assing values to each:
 * - Assign a number to myNumber.
 * - Assign a string to myString.
 * - Assign a boolean to turnedOn.
 * - Declare the noValue variable and assign no value to it (undefined).
 * - Declare the unknownValue variable and assign null value to it.
